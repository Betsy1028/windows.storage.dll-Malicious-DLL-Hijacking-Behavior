========== FILE METADATA ==========
File Name: windows.storage.dll
File Type: PE32+ DLL (x64)
File Description: "Microsoft WinRT Storage API" (spoofed)
Product Name: Microsoft® Windows® Operating System (spoofed)
Company Name: Microsoft Corporation (spoofed)
Original Filename: Windows.Storage.dll (spoofed)
File Size: ~6.6 MB
Timestamp: 2086-03-19 06:19:08 (invalid / tampered)
File Path Observed:
C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Temp\windows.storage.dll

========== EXECUTION CHAIN ==========
Parent Process:
explorer.exe

Execution via Signed Binary Proxy (LOLBIN):
regsvr32.exe "C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Temp\windows.storage.dll"

Technique:
T1218.010 - Regsvr32 Proxy Execution  
T1574.002 - DLL Hijacking  
T1036 - Masquerading

========== COMMAND LINES ==========
regsvr32.exe "C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Temp\windows.storage.dll"

========== REGISTRY ACTIVITY ==========
(None observed)

========== FILESYSTEM ACTIVITY ==========
File loaded: windows.storage.dll (no additional file writes observed)

========== NETWORK IOCs ==========
(No malicious domains or C2 activity detected)
Only Windows CRL/OCSP traffic was observed.

========== BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS ==========
- DLL Hijacking behavior detected
- Executed via regsvr32 (T1218.010)
- Masquerading as legitimate Microsoft DLL
- Unsigned DLL claiming Microsoft metadata
- Timestamp set far into the future (likely anti-forensics)
- Loaded from Temp directory instead of System32
- ANY.RUN verdict: MALICIOUS DLL hijacking

========== TACTICS + TECHNIQUES ==========
T1218.010 - Regsvr32 Execution  
T1574.002 - DLL Search Order Hijacking  
T1036 - Masquerading  
T1082 - System Information Discovery (potential)  
T1204 - User Execution (DLL registration)  

========== RECOMMENDED ACTIONS ==========
- Quarantine file immediately
- Review system for additional sideloaded DLLs
- Check for persistence (Run keys, Services, COM hijacking)
- Investigate for lateral movement attempts
- Validate integrity of legitimate Windows.Storage.dll
- Run endpoint AV/EDR sweep for related activity
